Minizinc_printer is a notebook that contains 2 code blocks:
- The first is used to print the data of the instance that is wanted to be run on the CP model.
- The second is used to print the output of the CP model in a clear way.

CPmodel is the Minizinc model designed to solve the problem for the project by Constraint Programming.

To run and get the output, for example, for the instance "inst01" on the CP model:
- Assign to the variable "temp" the value "inst01" on the first code block of Minizinc_printer and run the block.
- Copy and paste the printed values into the CP model in Minizinc.
- Open the file "Distance Matrix.txt" generated by the notebook.
- Copy and paste the distance matrix into the CP model in Minizinc .
- Run the CP model.
- Copy and paste the output printed by the model at the beginning of the second code block of Minizinc_printer.
